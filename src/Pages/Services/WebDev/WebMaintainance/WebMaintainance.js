        card1Description="Just like any other technology, your website needs to be updated and maintained for optimal performance. The technologies used to build websites change over time as new features are added, bugs are fixed, and security exploits are patched. Many websites go unmaintained for years at a time, leading to greatly reduced performance, 404 errors, or other errors breaking core functionality. We identify issues of performance, compatibility, and outdated plug-ins and information sources and optimize your website for the current state of the web.

We perform an in-depth media optimization analysis to determine which images, documents, videos, and sources for dynamic content are not being properly optimized. We then reduce their file size and decrease bandwidth and resource usage to optimize site loading times. This ensures that your website loads faster, reducing the frustration for your average user. Having a faster-loading website also has other benefits, like increased organic performance in the search results on major search engines.
